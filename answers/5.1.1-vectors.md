1. Dot product
    1. [E] Whatâ€™s the geometric interpretation of the dot product of two vectors? 

        *Answer:* The dot product of two vectors can be interpreted geometrically as the product of the magnitude of one vector and the projection of the other vector onto it.

    2. [E] Given a vector $$u$$, find vector $$v$$ of unit length such that the dot product of $$u$$ and $$v$$ is maximum.
        
        *Answer:* Since the projection of $u$ is maximum when $v$ is along $u$. So $v = \hat{u}$, a unit vector along $u$.

2. Outer product
    1. [E] Given two vectors $$a = [3, 2, 1]$$ and  $$b = [-1, 0, 1]$$. Calculate the outer product $$a^Tb$$?

        *Answer:* $[3,2,1]^T[-1,0,1] = [[-3,0,1],[-2,0,2],[-1,0,1]]$


    2. [M] Give an example of how the outer product can be useful in ML.

        *Answer:*
        1. The outer product of a point to itself can be used to create a higher-dimensional representation of a data point
        2. The outer product can be used to take two input vectors and create a new matrix, which can be used as a feature vector for an algorithm such as a neural network. 

3. [E] What does it mean for two vectors to be linearly independent?
    
    *Answer:* Two or more vectors are said to be linearly independent if none of them can be written as a linear combination of the others.

4. [M] Given two sets of vectors $$A = {a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n}$$ and $$B = {b_1, b_2, b_3, ... , b_m}$$. How do you check that they share the same basis?

    *Answer:*

5. [M] Given $$n$$ vectors, each of $$d$$ dimensions. What is the dimension of their span?

    *Answer:*

6. Norms and metrics
	1. [E] What's a norm? What is $$L_0, L_1, L_2, L_{norm}$$?

        *Answer:*

	2. [M] How do norm and metric differ? Given a norm, make a metric. Given a metric, can we make a norm?

        *Answer:*
